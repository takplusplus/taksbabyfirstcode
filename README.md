# taksbabyfirstcode
i am a literal noob and i don't know what im doing as of now

this is all in python. i know some javascript but python is easier for what im learning right now
all i know is that its the logic that matters not if you rememebr every single syntax. python is just
easier to remember so thats why i chose it becuase i wanna focus on like learning the logic behind stuff
cuz thats what programming is? idk

so ya this repo is some cringe code. i wrote a lot of it from the top of my head
some probaly are broken af or could of been done in a much simpler way
oh well. i tried to be clean about stuffs. 
the heads or tails one i had help with from my friend.

**my very early programs are kinda gone but this is most of the ones that i have done.**

**random markdown weee**

```py
print("ur mum")
```
see
i did a program

## what i am currently learning right now
- more python 
- fucking vim 

(excuse the language.)
